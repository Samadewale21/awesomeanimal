        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

        <p>The blue whale<em></em> is awesome because <strong></strong>The blue whale is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters and weighing up to 199 tonnes, it is the largest animal known ever to have existed. The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.</p>
